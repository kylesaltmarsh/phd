# PhD
Repository for data produced during my phd studies. The data includes frequency response functions produced through experimental, finite element and analytical methods. 

## Methods

### Experimental
The experimental frequency response functions were collected using an impact hammer and accelerometer. 

### Finite Element Analysis
FEA was performed in the software package [ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/)

### Analytical
Mathetmatical modelling was performed utilising the Modal Coupling method.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

The following python packages are required to run the scripts. 

```
pip install pandas
```
