# PhD
Repository for analytical model notebooks and experimental data produced during my phd candidature.

### Experimental Data
The experimental data was collected using a PULSE frequency analyzer and is in the native output of the system. The response if in the frequency domain and is split into its real and imaginary components. The frequency response functions can be reproduced by:

20Log(10,&#8730;(real^2 + imaginary^2))

### Analytical Modelling
The Mathematica notebooks contain the respective analytical models for the plate-air cavity and plate-water cavity systems.
